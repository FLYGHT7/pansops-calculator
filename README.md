The implementation is done in a projected coordinate system and currently there is no intention to use a purely geodesic calculation. 

The majority of the computations are done in meters with conversion in between so slight differences may be encounted. In DOC 8168 50 ft = 15 m which is not the case and this happens for many other units.
